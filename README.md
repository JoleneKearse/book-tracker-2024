This app **<span style="color: #996888">empowers</span>** users to:
- sign in and keep their information secure
- add newly read books
- view their library, including cover art
- verify they haven't already read a title before buying it
- get fun geeky reading stats

##  The Problem
<hr>
 
I am an avid customer of **Amazon Kindle** and **Audible**, but am missing a way to check which titles I've already read.  

It's not too big a deal in **Kindle Unlimited** as I can immediately see the last read page was at the end *and* I avoid *double-paying*.  

That is *not* the case in Audible.  I, for one, read a *ton* and find the synopses are insufficient to remind me I've already read that one. 

**Read, Track, Repeat** is the solution!   

## Challenges

### The API

The first **<span style="color: #996888">major challenge</span>** was not being an **Amazon affiliate**!  üòÜ  

As this is an app to track books from **Amazon Kindle** and **Audible** it was difficult to find an **API** for the book info.  I found the best way to search for info was via **ISBN**, but Amazon has it's own closed-**ASIN**-system.  Unless I was an affiliate, I couldn't easily get this info.  

I periodically went down a rabbit-hole üé©üê∞ searching for a better way to do what I'm doing, but always came up with nada.

I decided to chain two APIs, **The Open Library API** & **Google Books API**, to ensure I could grab as much info for my users as possible.  

The first was more comprehensive, but it is a giant pain in the üçë to ask users to find the ISBN by themselves, so I used to second to try and find the book and, *if possible*, grab the ISBN and try and fill in any missing data.  

Is this the best way?  

**No** and **yes**.

I'd prefer a simple way to grab the info from Amazon's ASIN.  But I haven't even found a *non-exorbent-fee* service to convert this code to an ISBN. (*I even considered border-line not-allowed web scrapping.*)

Over the course of a year, this is still the most convenient way I can serve my app's users.
