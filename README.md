# Read, Track, Repeat

This is digital book tracking app is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Supabase**, **React Router**, **Tailwind CSS** and **The Open Library** and **Google Books** APIs.

It empowers users to:
- sign in and keep their information secure
- add newly read books
- view their library, including cover art
- verify they haven't already read a title before buying it
- get fun geeky reading stats

##  The Problem
 
I am an avid customer of **Amazon Kindle** and **Audible**, but am missing a way to check which titles I've already read.  

It's not too big a deal in **Kindle Unlimited** as I can immediately see the last read page was at the end *and* I avoid *double-paying*.  

That is *not* the case in Audible.  I, for one, read a *ton* and find the synopses are insufficient to remind me I've already read that one. 

**Read, Track, Repeat** is the solution!
